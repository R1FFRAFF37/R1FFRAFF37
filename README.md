**In progress**

### Product Feature Analysis & A/B Testing  
End-to-end product analytics project simulating the work of a product analyst in a mass digital product:
- hypothesis formulation
- metric selection (conversion, retention)
- A/B test design (target uplift, MDE)
- statistical analysis (t-test, bootstrap, confidence intervals)
- business conclusions and recommendations

### Subscription Churn Prediction  
Machine learning project focused on churn prediction with a strong product mindset:
